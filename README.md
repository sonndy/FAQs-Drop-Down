## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS positioning
- Javascript DOM manipulation
- Javascript Event Listener


### What I learned

Instead of traversing the DOM trying to look for what elements the user clicked, I learn the importance of responding to the users click in order to run a block of code base on the element that is being clicked. Furthermore, I learn how to add specific style to hide or shown elements by toggling new CSS classes.
